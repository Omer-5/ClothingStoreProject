# Store Chain Management System

Welcome to the Store Chain Management System project repository for Internet Programming course at HIT - Holon Institute of Technology, Summer Semester 2023, under the guidance of Mr. Roi Zimon.

## Introduction
This project is a Client-Server application written in Java and using Azure SQL database.

In order to facilitate the Client-Server communication we developed a system to encode and decode actions and objects so we can send the data through a socket and take the appropriate action on the other side.
